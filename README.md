# CentSight
CentSight enables users to better actively manage thier finances by tracking accounts, recording transactions, and creating budgets.
****
### Why Active Tracking?
CentSight doesn't integrate with a user's bank account or credit cards. Why? Creation of a budget and management of spending requires you to be aware of where your money goes. The modern era makes it extremely easy to spend without a second thought. Sitting down, and actually tracking what you spend and where, can be a massive wake up call for most people. Getting into the routine of active tracking is difficult, but once a habit is built, it is invaluable to the user's financial health.
